      "articleBody": "Robotic knee replacement represents the latest advancement in joint replacement surgery. Using computer-assisted robotic technology, surgeons can perform knee replacement with enhanced precision, accurate implant positioning, and personalized alignment based on each patient's unique anatomy. The procedure begins with a pre-operative CT scan to create a 3D model of the patient's knee, allowing for detailed surgical planning. During surgery, the robotic system provides real-time feedback and precise guidance for bone preparation and implant placement. Benefits include potentially longer-lasting implants, better knee function, reduced soft tissue damage, less post-operative pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional knee replacement surgery.",
