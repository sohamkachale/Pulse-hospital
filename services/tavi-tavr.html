The procedure involves delivering a collapsible replacement valve through a catheter, typically via the femoral artery in the groin, and positioning it within the diseased aortic valve. Once in place, the new valve expands, pushing the old valve leaflets aside and taking over the valve's function. Benefits include shorter hospital stays, faster recovery, less pain, and avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass. Our Heart Team approach involves collaboration between interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, imaging specialists, and anesthesiologists to ensure optimal patient selection and outcomes.",
